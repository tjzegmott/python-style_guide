# python-style_guide

In this guide, you will learn how to style your python code to comply with our guidelines. Using what you have learnt from reading the 'Guidelines when using Python' page of the Onboarding repository, you will complete several tasks here to help you absorb the skills.

<!--
  <<< Author notes: Start of the course >>>
  Include start button, a note about Actions minutes,
  and tell the learner why they should take the course.
  Each step should be wrapped in <details>/<summary>, with an `id` set.
  The start <details> should have `open` as well.
  Do not use quotes on the <details> tag attributes.

<summary><h2>Step 1: Adding documentation strings</h2></summary>

_Welcome to "python-style_guide"! :wave:_

<!-- TBD-step-1-information -->
For the first step, lets add documentation strings to each of the functions defined in `hello_numbers.py`. Use the onboarding webpage to help you a short summary for each functions their parameters and returns.

**What is _documentation string_**: A documentation string (docstring) is a string that describes a module, function, class, or method definition.

``` python
def bar(var1: list, var2: int, var3: str = "hi", *args, **kwargs):
    """Short summary of the code

     Several sentences providing an extended description. Refer to
     variables using back-ticks, e.g. `var`.

     Parameters
     ----------
     var1 : array_like
         Array_like means all those objects -- lists, nested lists, etc. --
         that can be converted to an array.  We can also refer to
         variables like `var1`.
     var2 : int
         The type above can either refer to an actual Python type
         (e.g. ``int``), or describe the type of the variable in more
         detail, e.g. ``(N,) ndarray`` or ``array_like``.
     var3: {'hi', 'ho'}, optional
         Choices in brackets, default first when optional.
     *args : iterable
         Other arguments.
     **kwargs : dict
         Keyword arguments.

     Returns
     -------
     describe : type
         Explanation of return value named `describe`.
     out : type
         Explanation of `out`.
    """
```
### :keyboard: Activity: Writing docstrings

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Click on the **Pull requests** tab.
1. Select the pull request "_Start learning python styling_".
1. Click the tab **Files changed**.
1. For the file `hello_numbers.py`, click on the three dots, then select **Edit file**.
1. Write a short docstring for the following functions:
    1. `HelloWorld`
    1. `SqrNumber`
    1. `SqrtNumber`
    1. `main`
1. Click **Commit changes**.
1. Return to the main page of the repository. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<summary><h2>Step 2: Fixing import statements</h2></summary>

_You did Adding documentation strings! :tada:_

<!-- TBD-step-2-information -->
Packages and modules that are imported should always appear at the top of the file after any module comments or docstrings, but before constants. Only one package or module should be imported per line; multiple functions from a single package can be imported on one line though. Imports should be grouped in the following order:

1. Standard library imports.
1. Related third party imports.
1. Local application or library specific imports.

### :keyboard: Activity: Fixing import statements

1. Reopen the file `hello_numbers.py`.
1. Move the import statements within the file into the correct order.
1. Click **Commit changes**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<summary><h2>Step 3: Applying naming conventions</h2></summary>

_Nice work finishing Fixing import statements :sparkles:_

<!-- TBD-step-3-information -->
When naming anything, the names that are given should be descriptive and meaningful. Avoid the use of throwaway names such as "temp". The styling should also follow the convention below:

  - `package_name`
  - `module_name`
  - `ClassName`
  - `method_name`
  - `ExceptionName`
  - `function_name`
  - `CONSTANT_NAME`
  - `var_name`
  - `function_parameter_name`
  - `local_var_name`

### :keyboard: Activity: Applying naming conventions

1. Reopen the file `hello_numbers.py`.
1. Apply the information above to all variable and function names.
1. Click **Commit changes**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<summary><h2>Step 4: Adding type hinting to code</h2></summary>

_Nicely done Applying naming conventions! :partying_face:_

**What is _type hint_**: A type hint, or type annotation, is a way to indicate the type that a variable expects or that a function returns.

<!-- TBD-step-4-information -->
Type hinting can help to make code easier to understand and help to avoid TypeErrors. It can also be picked up by hooks such as `mypy` to spot errors in code.

``` python
def another(thing: str) -> str:
    return thing

def something(self, first_var: int):
    pass
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding type hinting to code

1. Reopen the file `hello_numbers.py`.
1. Add type hints to all the variables and functions in the file.
1. Click **Commit changes**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<summary><h2>Step 5: Writing tests for the functions</h2></summary>

_Sick work Applying naming conventions! :fireworks:_

**What is _test_**: A test is what it sounds like, a test. Tests can be written to check for any errors in the code.

<!-- TBD-step-5-information -->
The simplest type of test is an assertion, this is where we assert that something is true. An example of a test with an assertion is:

``` python
# Content of simple test
def func(x):
    return x + 1

def test_func(x):
    assert func(3) == 4
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Writing tests for the functions

1. Reopen the file `tests/test_hello_numbers.py`.
1. Using what you have learnt about tests, write a simple test for each function:
    1. `HelloWorld`
    1. `SqrNumber`
    1. `SqrtNumber`
1. Click **Commit changes**.
1. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.
